Before, I was making simple HTML and CSS pages with little to no JavaScript. John showed me how I can use TypeScript to better organize JavaScript and how to use a JavaScript framework with a \"serverless\" backend to power good-looking websites that are fast while still having fancy animations and large, single-page operations."

		"description": "Working with a team to create and maintain websites with WordPress, Angular, Flask, MySQL, and many other technologies for clients. My main job is to convert the clients ideas into code. I mostly work with WordPress as it gives the client an easy to use dashboard and simple page editing capabilities, but I have worked with Angular and Flask to create very specific pages that would have been much more complex if I had to make them with PHP in WordPress. In this position, I have learned a lot about CSS and the design of websites as well as how to efficiently store and retrieve data from relational and non-relational databases such as MySQL and MongoDB using REST APIs and server rendering."
